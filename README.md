# Mazes

![build status badge](https://github.com/guillonapa/mazes/workflows/Maven%20Build/badge.svg)

Library to generate rooms (or mazes) and interfaces for users to use when writing code for a "robot" to explore the generated rooms. The library's main purpose is academic â€“ to allow users to quickly code their own implementations of well-known algorithms for either exploring an unknown grid, or finding the path to exit a maze.
